# My First Swift Project - Facebook Login Screen #
I recently completed my first Swift project, where I created a Facebook login screen. This project was a great introduction to iOS development and helped me gain a better understanding of the Swift programming language.

## Project Overview ##
The goal of this project was to create a simple login screen that resembles the Facebook login screen. The screen contains two text fields for the user to input their email and password, as well as a "Login" button.

## Implementation Details ##
To create the login screen, I used Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment for creating iOS apps. I started by creating a new project and selecting the "Single View App" template. I then added two text fields and a button to the view controller's storyboard.

## Conclusion ##
Overall, I found this project to be a great introduction to iOS development and Swift programming. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Xcode, UIKit, and Swift syntax. I look forward to continuing to learn and develop my skills in iOS development.
